# About this project
Can we estimate the price of used cars?

This project aims to estimate used cars prices.

## Scenario
We have a friend name Tom, and Tom wants to sell his car, but the problem is *he doesn't know how much he should sell the car for*.
+ Is there data on the prices of other cars and their characteristics?
+ What features of cars affect their prices?

## Data set
I am going to use an open data set by *Jeffrey C. Schlimmer*.
The data set is in CSV format and doesn't have headers.
You can check the data set [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data)
